#This is a probabilities algorithm. 
#Let's see how to use it.
#Rules:
#You set your total amount you want to play and a starting amount you want to begin with.
#Program returns how many tries you have, as well as your winnining percentage.
#You have to play on at least equitable events. For our example, choose events from 1.85 and above. Every time you loose, multiply your starting amount with 2.20 
#Finally, you could perform a demonstration with your numbers to find out if it works.
